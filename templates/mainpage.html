            Widelands is an open source (GPLed) real-time strategy
            game. It is built upon the <a
               href='http://www.libsdl.org'>SDL</a> and other open
            source libraries and is (and will always be) under heavy development. If
            you knew Settlers I &amp; II&#8482; (Â© Bluebyte), then you
            already have a rough idea what Widelands is all about because
            widelands is heavily inspired by those two games. 
      </p>
   <p>
            You can find detailed information on the game in our <a
               href="/wiki">Wiki</a>. I you want to get a quick Overview, go to
            the <a title="About Widelands" href="{% url wiki_article "AboutWidelands" %}">AboutWidelands</a> page.
      </p>
            
   <p>
            You can download the game on the <a href="{% url wiki_article "DownloadPage" %}">DownloadPage</a>.  You can also find

            there.
