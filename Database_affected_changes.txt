# South:
    South is now integrated into django, see
    http://south.readthedocs.org/en/latest/releasenotes/1.0.html#library-migration-path

    An upgrading from old south migrations to django is decribed here:
    https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/topics/migrations/#upgrading-from-south

    Should be easy. I tested this with mysql and a copy from wl_alpha ... it works :-)

# User model
    The current setting in settings.py:

    AUTH_PROFILE_MODULE = 'wlprofile.Profile'

    Has been removed in Django 1.7. The corresponding get_profile() method is gone away with that.
    Re: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/releases/1.5/#auth-profile-module
    
    Found a solution for get_profile() but i am unsure with the AUTH_PROFILE_SETTING.

# Django-notifications
    Changing this to pinax-notification the old table do not work anymore.
    Didn't found a solution to get pinax to work yet.
