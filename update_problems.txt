# Django-ratings
   django-ratings is no longer maintained; see
   https://github.com/dcramer/django-ratings
  
   django-ratings is currently used only in wlmaps. We could either adjust django ratings or use
   alternative: django-star-ratings (py3 ready)

# Django-tracking
   The original django-tracking is disowned, see http://www.codekoala.com/posts/django-projects/
   User bashu has adopt it, see: https://github.com/bashu/django-tracking
   But it looks not really maintained.
  
   django-tracking requires django.contrib.geoip which 
   requires Python GeoIP 1.3.2.
   Django.contrib.geoip gets deprecated in Dajngo 1.9 in favour of
   django.contrib.gis.geoip2, which supports IPv6 and the GeoLite2 database format.

# django.contrib.markup
   Module is stripped out of django. There is a Pypi package for a backward-compatible quick fix:
   https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-markup-deprecated
  
   Simple replacemant for markdown filter: https://gist.github.com/defrex/6194514

Settings and other stuff

# User model
   The current setting in settings.py:
  
   AUTH_PROFILE_MODULE = 'wlprofile.Profile'
  
   Has been removed in Django 1.7. I am not sure how to handle this change at the moment.
   See also Database_affected_changes.txt

# Sorting of fields in Forms
   The old 'keyOrder = ["fields"]' isn't available in Django 1.8
   In Django 1.9 a new function 'order_keys' get's implemented.
   Until then it is possible to order the fields in class Meta:
   f.e.: fields = ['name','body', 'markup', 'attachment',]

# Migrations
   Added migrations to all our apps except wlscreens because it uses lambdas and
   lambdas couldn't be handled by makemigrations.
