# South:
    South is now integrated into django, see
    http://south.readthedocs.org/en/latest/releasenotes/1.0.html#library-migration-path

    An upgrading from old south migrations to django is decribed here:
    https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/topics/migrations/#upgrading-from-south

    Should be easy. I tested this with mysql and a copy from wl_alpha ... it works
    
    Original migration: 
    http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~widelands-dev/widelands-website/trunk/revision/323#pybb/migrations/0001_initial.py

# django-sphinx (sphinxdoc)
   Not longer maintained, see: https://github.com/dcramer/django-sphinx
   
   This is used for the search. An alternative is maybe django-sphinxdoc in combination with
   haystack (dependencie of django-sphinxdoc).

Settings and other stuff
########################

# User model
   The current setting in settings.py:
  
   AUTH_PROFILE_MODULE = 'wlprofile.Profile'
  
   Has been removed in Django 1.7. I am not sure how to handle this change at the moment.
   See also Database_affected_changes.txt

   Found a solution for get_profile() but i am unsure with the AUTH_PROFILE_SETTING.

# Sorting of fields in Forms
   The old 'keyOrder = ["fields"]' isn't available in Django 1.8
   In Django 1.9 a new function 'order_keys' get's implemented.
   Until then it is possible to order the fields in class Meta:
   f.e.: fields = ['name','body', 'markup', 'attachment',]
