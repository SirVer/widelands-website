# Django-ratings
   django-ratings is no longer maintained; see
   https://github.com/dcramer/django-ratings
  
   django-ratings is currently used only in wlmaps. We could either adjust django ratings or use
   alternative: django-star-ratings (py3 ready)

# Django-tracking
   The original django-tracking is disowned, see http://www.codekoala.com/posts/django-projects/
   User bashu has adopt it, see: https://github.com/bashu/django-tracking
   But it looks not really maintained.
  
   django-tracking requires django.contrib.geoip which 
   requires Python GeoIP 1.3.2.
   Django.contrib.geoip gets deprecated in Dajngo 1.9 in favour of
   django.contrib.gis.geoip2, which supports IPv6 and the GeoLite2 database format.

# Django-notifications
   The old project is forked and is renamed to pinax-notifications
   Backwarts icompatible changes to the old version used by us:
    BI: renamed Notice.user to Notice.recipient
    BI: renamed {{ user }} context variable in notification templates to {{ recipient }}
    BI: added nullable Notice.sender and modified send_now and queue to take an optional sender
    BI: split settings part of notices view to its own view notice_settings

# django.contrib.markup
   Module is stripped out of django. There is a Pypi package for a backward-compatible quick fix:
   https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-markup-deprecated
  
   Simple replacemant for markdown filter: https://gist.github.com/defrex/6194514
  
# threadedcomments throws some errors at startup
   I don't know why threadedcomments is used at all, because django-comments has the same 
   functionality? See https://django-contrib-comments.readthedocs.org/en/latest/example.html
   and also Database_affected_changes.txt

Settings and other stuff

# User model
   The current setting in settings.py:
  
   AUTH_PROFILE_MODULE = 'wlprofile.Profile'
  
   Has been removed in Django 1.7. I am not sure how to handle this change at the moment.
   See also Database_affected_changes.txt

# Sorting of fields in Forms
   The old 'keyOrder = ["fields"]' isn't available in Django 1.8
   In Django 1.9 a new function 'order_keys' get's implemented.
   Until then it is possible to order the fields in class Meta:
   f.e.: fields = ['name','body', 'markup', 'attachment',]

# Messages ( regards to wiki )
   The Message model (in django.contrib.auth), its related manager in the User model
   (user.message_set), and the associated methods (user.message_set.create() and
   user.get_and_delete_messages()), will be removed. The messages framework should be
   used instead. The related messages variable returned by the auth context processor
   will also be removed. Note that this means that the admin application will depend
   on the messages context processor.
