Update problems:

# South:
South is now integrated into django, see
http://south.readthedocs.org/en/latest/releasenotes/1.0.html#library-migration-path

An upgrading from old south migrations to django is decribed here:
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/topics/migrations/#upgrading-from-south

Should be easy.

# Django-ratings
django-ratings is no longer maintained; see
https://github.com/dcramer/django-ratings

django-ratings is currently used only in wlmaps. We could either adjust django ratings or drop it.

# Django-tracking
django-tracking requires django.contrib.geoip which 
requires Python GeoIP 1.3.2. Django.contrib.geoip gets deprecated in Dajngo 1.9 in favour of django.contrib.gis.geoip2, which supports IPv6 and the GeoLite2 database format.

# Others
Trouble with notifications in /wiki/models.py
