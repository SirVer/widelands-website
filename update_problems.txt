Update problems:

# Django-ratings
  django-ratings is no longer maintained; see
  https://github.com/dcramer/django-ratings
  
  django-ratings is currently used only in wlmaps. We could either adjust django ratings or use
  alternative: django-star-ratings (py3 ready)

# Django-tracking
  The original django-tracking is disowned, see http://www.codekoala.com/posts/django-projects/
  User bashu has adopt it, see: https://github.com/bashu/django-tracking
  But it looks not really maintained.
  
  django-tracking requires django.contrib.geoip which 
  requires Python GeoIP 1.3.2.
  Django.contrib.geoip gets deprecated in Dajngo 1.9 in favour of
  django.contrib.gis.geoip2, which supports IPv6 and the GeoLite2 database format.

# Django-notifications
  The old project is forked and is renamed to pinax-notifications
  Backwarts icompatible changes to the old version used by us:
    BI: renamed Notice.user to Notice.recipient
    BI: renamed {{ user }} context variable in notification templates to {{ recipient }}
    BI: added nullable Notice.sender and modified send_now and queue to take an optional sender
    BI: split settings part of notices view to its own view notice_settings

# User model
  The current setting in settings.py:
  
  AUTH_PROFILE_MODULE = 'wlprofile.Profile'
  
  Has been removed in Django 1.7. I am not sure how to handle this change at the moment.

# Sorting of fields in Forms
  The old 'keyOrder = ["fields"]' isn't available in Django 1.8
  In Django 1.9 a new function 'order_keys' get's implemented.
  Until then it is possible to order the fields in class Meta:
  f.e.: fields = ['name','body', 'markup', 'attachment',]
