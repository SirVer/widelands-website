This is the old version (0.1.4) of the notification app by James Tauber.
It is included as a widelands app because the new version is 
incompatible with our old data.

Year 2017:
The ability to store notices is removed and therefor it acts only as an app
to send e-mails for observed items.

Original Description:
=====================

Many sites need to notify users when certain events have occurred and to allow
configurable options as to how those notifications are to be received.

The project aims to provide a Django app for this sort of functionality. This
includes:

 * submission of notification messages by other apps
 * notification messages on signing in
 * notification messages via email (configurable by user)
 * notification messages via feed
